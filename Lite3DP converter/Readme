This software was created to facilitate the process of converting and saving layer images for 3D printing.

It is currently available for Windows and Linux (February 3, 2021 update).

Note for Linux: works with Debian / Ubuntu on desktop computers. Requires the "unzip" command.

As an alternative to this software, the following steps can be carried out:

1) Unzip the ZIP file from Chitubox. This contains numbered PNG images.
2) Use batch image conversion software to convert all PNG images to 24-bit BMP images.
3) Create a folder on the micro SD card and copy all the BMP images there. The name of this folder will appear on the Lite3DP to be selected.
